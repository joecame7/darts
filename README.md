I usually play darts quite often for fun, there is a game I sometimes play called cricket, and usually we use an app or website to keep track of our cricket progress like a scoreboard. However, for every scoreboard I've seen, there was always something non-ideal about it. Therefore, I decided to create my own version which is made as simple as possible for mobile devices so I can quickly whip it up on my phone and enjoy the game.

It is not perfect, but it works well. I wanted to add some extra features like changing the player name, and fix some small bugs I've found, but my web design skills ain't the best and was unsuccessful. Maybe in the future, I will have the skills necessary to sort this out and I definitely will as it was fustrating to fix. But for now, I am going to use this as it pretty much works flawlessly.
